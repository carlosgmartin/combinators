# Combinatory logic

Combinatory logic is a model of computation that can perform the same computations as the untyped lambda calculus (i.e. is Turing-complete) without the use of variables, purely in terms of rewriting rules.

# Algorithmic information theory

Algorithmic information theory (AIT) is a field of computer science that studies the relationship between information and computation. It provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for various philosophical principles such as Occam's razor, epistemic induction, learning in the limit, and intelligence (through AGI).

# Solomonoff induction
Solomonoff induction is a theory of inductive inference grounded in AIT that considers all possible computable hypotheses in a Bayesian framework. Each hypothesis is weighed by a prior, usually a function of its length or running time (to penalize complex hypotheses).

# AIXI
Solomonoff induction (Levin search, etc.) can be combined with sequential decision theory to create a universal AI that calculates the expected value of an action in an optimal way (see AIXI).
